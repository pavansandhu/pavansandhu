Hi! I'm Pavan and welcome to my GitHub. I've just started my journey as a software developer but I have been a Mechanical Engineer for over 10 years working in manufacturing environments in different capacities. From designer, operations engineer to project manager and everything in between. 

You may ask, why software engineering? Well I've always had a passion to learn how to code and create my own applications, and through working in different industries, I've had the unique perspective of seeing how software applications can improve process inefficiencies and make things safer for everyone in a manufacturing environment. After 10 years, I had the opportunity to pursue my journey to become a software developer and I can't be stopped! I'm a life long learner and always strive to be the best I can. 

I thrive in agile environments where innovation and collaboration drive success. I have the unique ability to take user requirements and produce effective and unique solutions.
